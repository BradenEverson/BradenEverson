I believe in the power of Deep Learning and the future it can provide for all industries. Through creating Neural Network platforms in the form of open source crates for the Rust ecosystem, I believe that I can help in bringing Machine Learning to the forefront of Rust's powers 🦀🦾

Currently, I am working on a Rust crate dubbed Triton 🦎. Triton aims to bring the ease of the Tensorflow and Keras library into the world of Rust without being a wrapper library. With Rust's low level performance and high level zero-cost abstractions, I believe that Rust truly can become the ML Language of the future 🧠⚙️
