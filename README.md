#### I am fascinated by the world of Embedded Systems, Rust, Machine Learning and the unions that these three topics hold. I believe that Rust can serve not only as the future of machine learning, but its embedded runtimes can bring new avenues and use cases for Machine Learning in embedded environments 🦀🦾

#### Currently, I am working on a Rust crate named Unda 🌊. Unda aims to bring accelerated Machine Learning through the XLA library into Rust. Ensuring robust types and blazingly fast model training 🧠⚙️

#### Unda has ranked in 4th place for the [MSOE Rosie Supercomputer Challenge](https://www.msoe.edu/rosie-challenge/)!
