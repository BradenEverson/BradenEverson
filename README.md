#### I am fascinated by the world of Deep Learning along with all of the ramifications it holds for the future of our world. I believe that bringing Rust to the forefront of the ML revolution is how we truly revolutionize the applications of this technology 🦀🦾

#### Currently, I am working on a Rust crate named Unda 🌊. Unda aims to bring the ease of the Tensorflow and Keras library into the world of Rust without being a wrapper library 🧠⚙️
