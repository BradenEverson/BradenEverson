## Hi :D
I'm an Undergraduate Computer Science student going for a Computer Engineering minor at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. I love working at the systems level, with Rust, Zig or C being my go to languages :)

**Current Position**: Firmware Engineering Intern at Milwaukee Tool working with new BLE features!

**Currently Working on**: A Chip8 Emulator that targets Stm32 and WASM :)
