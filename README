I'm an Undergraduate Computer Science student going for a Computer Engineering minor at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. I love working on cool low level stuff like operating system components, embeded stuff, all things systems programming, and designing languages.

I'm currently working on a preemptive RTOS scheduler with ML informed time quantum slices as a part of my Undergraduate Research, feel free to check it out on my profile :)
