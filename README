I'm a Computer Science undergrad and Computer Engineering minor at MSOE, focused on low-level systems, with an interest in OS components and compiler design. I'm currently building an ML-informed RTOS scheduler running on Stm32 hardware as undergraduate research.

I'm super driven by unique challenges and projects that let me create awesome stuff, especially things that dive into communication protocols, distributed systems, parsers, compilers, or embedded design. I love building systems from the ground up :)
