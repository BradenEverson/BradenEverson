I'm an Undergraduate Computer Science student going for a Computer Engineering minor at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. I love working on cool low level stuff like operating system components, embeded stuff, all things systems programming, and designing languages.

I'm currently working on an RTOS scheduler with ML informed context switch priorities as a part of my Undergraduate Research, feel free to check it out on my profile or reach out to me with any thoughts :)
